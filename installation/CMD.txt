1. Login to OpenShift
---------------------
Start by logging into your OpenShift cluster.

# Log in to OpenShift
oc login https://<your-openshift-api-server>:<port> --token=<your-token>

# Verify your current user and context
oc whoami
oc project

2. Basic Namespace and Project Management
-----------------------------------------
# List all projects
oc get projects

# Create a new project
oc new-project my-project

# Switch to a different project
oc project <project-name>

# Delete a project
oc delete project <project-name>

3. Working with Pods
--------------------
# List all pods in the current namespace
oc get pods

# Get detailed information about a specific pod
oc describe pod <pod-name>

# View logs of a pod
oc logs <pod-name>

# Execute a command inside a running pod
oc exec -it <pod-name> -- /bin/bash

4. Deployments
--------------
# Create a new app from an image or source code
oc new-app <image-or-source-url> --name=<app-name>

# Get all deployments
oc get deployments

# Scale a deployment
oc scale --replicas=<number> deployment/<deployment-name>

# Rollback to a previous deployment
oc rollout undo deployment/<deployment-name>

5. Services and Routes
----------------------
# List all services
oc get svc

# Expose a deployment as a service
oc expose deployment/<deployment-name> --port=<port> --target-port=<target-port>

# Create a route to the service
oc expose svc/<service-name>

# Get routes
oc get routes

6. Storage Management
---------------------
# List persistent volume claims (PVCs)
oc get pvc

# Create a PVC (via YAML or CLI)
oc create -f pvc.yaml

# Bind a PVC to a pod (in the pod spec)
oc set volume pod/<pod-name> --add --name=<volume-name> --claim-name=<pvc-name> --mount-path=<mount-path>

7. Configurations and Secrets
-----------------------------
# List ConfigMaps
oc get configmaps

# Create a ConfigMap
oc create configmap <configmap-name> --from-literal=<key>=<value>

# List secrets
oc get secrets

# Create a secret
oc create secret generic <secret-name> --from-literal=<key>=<value>

8. Working with YAML
--------------------
# Export resource YAML
oc get <resource-type> <resource-name> -o yaml > resource.yaml

# Apply changes from a YAML file
oc apply -f resource.yaml

# Delete a resource from a YAML file
oc delete -f resource.yaml

9. Monitoring and Debugging
---------------------------
# Watch resource changes
oc get pods --watch

# Debug a pod
oc debug pod/<pod-name>

# Check cluster events
oc get events

10. OpenShift-Specific Resources
--------------------------------
# List Builds and Image Streams
oc get builds
oc get imagestreams

# Trigger a new build
oc start-build <build-config-name>

# View build logs
oc logs build/<build-name>

11. Cleanup
-----------
# Delete a pod
oc delete pod <pod-name>

# Delete all resources of a specific type
oc delete all --all
